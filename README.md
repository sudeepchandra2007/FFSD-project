# FFSD-project
creating a wellness program management platform
## PROBLEM STATEMENT :
The employees in corporate companies undergo a huge amount of stress due to heavy work load, tight deadlines etc. in order to reduce the stress and ensure good mental and physical health of the employees, most companies run wellness programs  but, without a centralized and coordinated system, the programs are highly inefficient. So we are building a platform which coordinates all the wellness programs at one place
