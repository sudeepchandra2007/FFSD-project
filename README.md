## Problem Statement: Wellness Program Management Platform
Modern organizations conduct multiple wellness programs to improve employee mental and physical health. However, these programs are often managed independently, leading to poor coordination, low participation, and limited visibility into their effectiveness. The lack of a unified platform prevents organizations from efficiently organizing, tracking, and optimizing wellness initiatives, thereby limiting their potential benefits.

The objective of the platform is to streamline the management of employee wellness programs by providing a centralized and organized system that enhances accessibility, coordination, and effectiveness.
